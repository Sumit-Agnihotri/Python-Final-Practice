print("Specify a Variable Type\nThere may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.\n\nCasting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:\n\n1-> int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)\n2-> float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)\n3-> str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals")
#Integers Example:
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3

#Floats Example:
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
