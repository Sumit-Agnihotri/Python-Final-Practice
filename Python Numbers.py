# PYTHON NUMBERS
print("There are 3 types of Python Numbers:\n1. int\n2. float\n3. complex")
# For example:
w=1
x=1.5
y="Sumit"
z=True
print("w is of type:",type(w))
print("x is of type:",type(x))
print("y is of type:",type(y))
print("z is of type:",type(z))

print("INTEGER NUMBERS")
print("Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.")
# For example:
a=1
b=35656222554887711
c=-3255522
print("a is of type:",type(a))
print("b is of type:",type(b))
print("c is of type:",type(c))

print("FLOAT NUMBERS")
print("Float, or 'floating point number' is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.")
# For example:
d=1.10
e=1.0
f=-35.59
print("d is of type:",type(d))
print("e is of type:",type(e))
print("f is of type:",type(f))

print("COMPLEX NUMBERS")
print("Complex numbers are written with a 'j' as the imaginary part.")
# For example:
g=3+5j
h=5j
i=-5j
print("g is of type:",type(g))
print("h is of type:",type(h))
print("i is of type:",type(i))

print("TYPE CONVERSION")
print("We can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods.")

# For example:
j=1
k=complex(j)
print(k)

i=3
j=float(i)
print(j)

i=3.4
j=int(i)
print(j)
