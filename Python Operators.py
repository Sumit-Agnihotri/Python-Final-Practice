# PYTHON OPERATORS
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# 1:- Arithmetic operators
# 2:- Assignment operators
# 3:- Comparison operators
# 4:- Logical operators
# 5:- Identity operators
# 6:- Membership operators
# 7:- Bitwise operators

a=2
b=3
print("1:- Arithmetic operators")
print(a+b) # Addition
print(a-b) # Subtraction
print(a*b) # Multiplication
print(a/b) # Division
print(a%b) # Modulus
print(a**b) # Exponentiation
print(a//b) # Floor division
